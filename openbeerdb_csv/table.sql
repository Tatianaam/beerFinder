VALUES('GreatLakesPorter.jpeg', 'Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald', 'Porter', '6.0%', 'Complex, roasty aroma with a bittersweet, chocolate-coffee taste and a bold hop presence.

VALUES ('SweatwaterPorter.png', 'Sweetwater Georgia Brown', 'English Brown Ale', '5.1%', 'The malt bill gives a subtle nutty & toasty flavors and the chocolate malt provides a rich cocoa flavor with aromas that range from roasted coffee to chocolate-covered dark fruits.

A light dose of hops brings balance to all.');

INSERT INTO beers (imgString, name, style, abv, description)
VALUES('MonkeyBoy.png', 'Monkey Boy', 'German Hefeweizen', '4.8%', 'Smooth, subtle wheat beer with hints of banana and spice. Great in the summer and very drinkable. Light, not overwhelming but interesting flavor. Mildly carbonated and refreshing.');

VALUES('QuadWeyerbacher.jpeg', 'QUAD by Weyerbacher Brewing Co.', 'Belgian Quadrupel - Dark Ale', '11.8%', 'An elegant and dark ale. Rich with complexity and flavor, try savoring it after a long day or during a fine dinner. You also might enjoy it as an aperitif or as an accompaniment to a dessert, but QUAD stands alone quite well. We recommend enjoying QUAD in a brandy snifter or wineglass so you can drink in the aroma of this fine elixir.');

VALUES ('FatTire.jpeg', 'Fat Tire', 'Amber Ale', '5.2%', 'It is a classic amber with biscuit notes and a soft warming alcohol touch in the aroma and flavor. The hops arent your typical citrus hops, but they are still refreshing and crisp.');
